## Overview
The Order Summary Card Challenge, on Frontend Mentor presents a responsive preview of a desktop order summary card. This challenge evaluates your HTML and CSS skills in creating a organized and attractive card that provides an overview of an order.

Notable Features;

Layout and Styling; The order summary card uses a combination of HTML elements and CSS styles to achieve a design that's visually appealing. It includes information like the product image, product name order details, total cost and a call to action button.

Responsive Design; The card is designed to adapt to desktop screen sizes ensuring a consistent and user friendly experience. The layout and content adjust gracefully to fit screens.

Eye catching Color Scheme; Careful selection of colors adds appeal. Creates a harmonious design for the card. It highlights elements making the card visually engaging.

Call to Action Button; The colored call to action button stands out encouraging users to take action such, as proceeding with the order or making modifications.
CSS Flexbox is used to create a layout that's flexible and responsive allowing the card elements to be properly aligned and spaced on desktop screens.

By using HTML elements we ensure that the card is well structured and accessible. This not benefits search engine optimization. Also makes it easier, for assistive technologies to interact with the content.

To enhance interactivity and provide feedback for users we apply hover effects to elements such, as buttons.
